The practical sessions of the tutorial will be carried out using a Docker image. Therefore, in case Docker is not installed in your computer, please follow the following steps.

Docker allows the execution of a container with pre-installed tools and pre-loaded datasets. Thus, it removes the hurdle of installing dependencies and makes it easier to reproduce full analyses by different researchers.

- [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://desktop.docker.com/win/stable/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)
- [Docker Desktop Mac with Intel chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/stable/amd64/Docker.dmg?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=docs-driven-download-mac-amd64)
- [Docker Desktop Mac with Appple chip](https://desktop.docker.com/mac/stable/arm64/Docker.dmg?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=docs-driven-download-mac-arm64)


A detailed installation guide can be found here:
