## Is this course for me?

In this two-day course, we want to give you an introduction to working with R in simple data analysis tasks; you will learn the basic principles of reading in a data table, doing some descriptive statistics, making nice plots.
On the second day, we will focus on a simple single-cell analysis workflow, which will guide you through the first steps of this kind of analysi!

On the first day, we will guide you through the first steps of working with R, from reading data to exploratory analysis and basic statistics.

1. Getting started with RStudio
2. Reading in a data table
3. Simple descriptive statistics
4. Performing statistical tests
4. Making plots!
                                                   

### Day 2: a simple single-cell RNA-seq analysis workflow

On the second day, we will go through a step by step simple analysis of a small scRNA-seq dataset using the Seurat toolkit.

1. Reading the data
2. Creating a SEURAT object
3. Basic QC and normalization 
4. Visualization (UMAP) and cell clustering
5. Differential expression analysis

## Technical pre-requisites

Every participant will work on her/his own laptop. The easiest way to work with R is using the **RStudio** interface.
Please install RStudio Desktop prior to the start of the course:

1. first install R for your operating system; you will find the correct version [on this website](https://cran.rstudio.com/) 
2. once R is installed, you can isntall the RStudio Desktop version, which you find [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)

Please check that you can open RStudio without error message!
